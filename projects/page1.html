    <h2>You should love trees.</h2>

They just think trees are just there. They don't know what their purpose is or what they do. Those people are very ungrateful.</p>
    <p>We should all learn to love trees because they help us in everything. A single tree absorbs 13-pounds of carbon dioxide per year.</p>
    <p>Just one acre of newly planted trees absorbs 2.5 tons of CO2 annually.</p>
    <p><b>So stop cutting down our trees.</b></p>

    <h2>Valid Reasons to Love Trees</h2>
  <ol>
    <dl>
    <li><b>Trees work hard to make our wrongs right.</b></li>
    <dd>According to the U.S. Forest Service, the trees around the world removed about one-third of fossil fuel emissions annually between 1990 to 2007.</dd><br>
    <li><b>They give us oxygen.</b></li>
    <dd>Four people can get a dayâ€™s worth of oxygen from one large tree. (You don't deserve it if you don't appreciate trees.)</dd><br>
    <li><b>They give us supplies.</b></li>
    <dd>Ground up wood is used to make paper for magazines, newspapers, candy wrappers, and cereal boxes. Sap is used to make maple syrup, chewing gum, crayons, paint, and soap.</dd><br>
    <li><b>Trees let us climb them.</b></li>
    <dd>If you have never climbed a tree then you really don't appreciate trees.</dd><br>
    <li><b>Trees keep our houses clean.</b></li>
    <dd>A study from Lancaster University found that trees by the road reduced the presence of airborne particulate matter (pollution from cars) inside nearby homes by 50 percent.</dd><br>

    <h3>The list goes on but those are just a couple good reasons.</h3>

    <p>All these newspapers and magazines were made from ground up wood. Ground of wood comes from trees. So newspapers and magazines come from trees.</p>

    <p>This house is very lucky. It has a tree reducing the pollution that enters the house. Instead of worrying about the tree falling on the house, whoever lives in the house should be very thankful that the trees are there.</p>
