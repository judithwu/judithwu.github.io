    <h2>12 Interesting Facts About Trees</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Trees are the longest living organisms on Earth.</li><br>
      <li><p><img class="floatimage" src="/images/pine.jpg">Pine trees grow on every continent except for Antarctica.</p></li><br>
      <li>The parts of a tree grow at different times throughout the year. Typically, most of the foliage growth happens in the spring, followed by trunk growth in the summer and root growth in the fall and winter.</li><br>
      <li>Trees are able to communicate and defend themselves against insects. Scientists have found that trees can flood their leaves with chemicals called phenolics when insects come. They can also signal danger to other trees.</li><br>
      <li>Trees drink about 2,000 liters of water each year.</li><br>
      <li>About one third of the United States of America is covered by forests.</li><br>
      <li>Earth has more than 60,000 known tree species.</li><br>
      <li>The first known tree was a leafless, fern-like plant from New York. It was called Wattieza. </li><br>
      <li>Trees help improve our water quality as they slow and filter rainfall.</li><br>
      <li>A shade tree can help cool your house by as much as 20 degrees when it's hot.</li><br>
      <li>The biggest tree is a giant sequoia in Californiaâ€™s Redwood Forest. It measures about 30 stories tall and 82 feet in circumference.</li><br>
      <li>Most tree roots stay in the top 18 inches of soil, but they can also grow above ground or grow a few hundred feet deep.</li><br>

    <h2>People also Ask</h2>
    <h3>How do trees grow?</h3>
    <p>Trees grow taller when new cells are produced at the tips of twigs, causing the twigs to grow longer. Tree trunks and branches grow thicker as new cells are added beneath the bark. These cells make up vessels, called xylem and phloem, that carry nutrients throughout the tree.</p>
    <h3>Do trees grow up or out?</h3>
    <p>Trees grow from the root upwards and the trunk increases by one annular ring every year. The leaves and branches grow at the top, as the lower branches tend to die off unless someone takes care of it.</p>
    <h3>How do you kill a tree?</h3>
    <p>Drill into the truck several times. If you want too completely kill tree roots, fill the holes with salt, herbicide or nitrogen. Once the tree stump is dead, it can be chopped out easily.</p>
    <h3>How long does it take for a tree to grow?</h3>
    <p>Some trees are slow (20-30 years to reach full size) and some are fast (10-15 years).</p>
    <h3>How do you know if a tree is dead or alive?</h3>
    <p>Scratching bark. One of the best ways to determine if a tree or any plant is dead is the tree scratch test. Just beneath the dry, outer layer of bark in a tree's trunk lies the cambium layer of bark. In a living tree, this is green; in a dead tree, it is brown and dry.</p>

    <p>Many people ask if trees can really communicate with each other. They actually can. They obviously don't talk but they do "talk" with each other by sharing nutrients with each other through an underground internet built by soil fungi.</p>

    <p>A healthy tree can increase your property value by as much as 27 percent while trees with dead branches, hollow cavities and other problems can decrease your property value. So make sure you take good care of your tree so your property value will increase.</p>
